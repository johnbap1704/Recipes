"title": "Apricot Almond Cake",
"ingredients": "150 grams dried apricots\n250 ml cold water\n2 cardamom pods (cracked)\n200 grams ground almonds\n50 grams fine polenta (not instant)\n1 teaspoon baking powder (gluten-free if required)\n150 grams caster sugar\n6 large eggs\n2 teaspoons lemon juice\n1 teaspoon rosewater\nnonstick spray (or sunflower oil) for greasing\nTO DECORATE\n2 teaspoons apricot jam (or rose petal jam)\n1 teaspoon lemon juice\n2 1/2 teaspoons very finely chopped pistachios",
"method": "You will need 1 x 20cm (8 inch) round springform cake tin\nPut the dried apricots into a small saucepan, cover them with the cold water, and drop in the cracked cardamom pods with their fragrant seeds. Put on the heat, then bring to the boil and let it bubble for 10 minutes – do not stray too far away from the pan, as by the end of the 10 minutes the pan will be just about out of water and you want to make sure it doesn’t actually run dry as the apricots will absorb more water as they cool\nTake the pan off the heat, place on a cold, heatproof surface and let the apricots cool. Preheat the oven to 180C. Grease the sides of your springform cake tin and line the bottom with baking parchment\nRemove 5 of the dried apricots and tear each in half, then set aside for the time being. Discard the cardamom husks, leaving the seeds in the pan\nPour and scrape out the sticky contents of the pan into the bowl of a food processor. Add the ground almonds, polenta, baking powder, caster sugar and eggs, and give a good long blitz to combine\nOpen the top of the processor, scrape down the batter, add 2 teaspoons of lemon juice and the rosewater, and blitz again. Then scrape into the prepared tin and smooth with a spatula. Arrange the apricot halves around the circumference of the tin\nBake for 40 minutes, though if the cake is browning up a lot before it is actually ready, you may want to cover loosely with foil at the 30 minute mark. When it is ready, the cake will be coming away from the edges of the tin, the top will feel firm, and a cake tester will come out with just one or two damp crumbs on it\nRemove the cake to a wire rack. If you are using apricot jam to decorate, you may want to warm it a little first so that it is easier to spread; rose petal jam is so lusciously soft-set, it shouldn’t need any help. Stir a teaspoon of lemon juice into the jam and brush over the top of the cake, then sprinkle with the chopped pistachios and leave the cake to cool in its tin before unspringing and removing to a plate"

Leave in the tins for 10 minutes before turning out to cool on a wire rack\nMeanwhile, prepare the buttercream.
